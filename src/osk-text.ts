// The on-screen keyboard's text state, as pure functions: a value and a caret inside it, plus the rule
// for what each field mode will accept at all. DOM-free and electron-free, so the editing itself is
// unit-testable while osk.ts keeps only the keys, the focus and the painting.
//
// The caret is counted in CODE POINTS, not in UTF-16 code units. A game's title is the one field here
// that routinely holds something outside the basic plane — an emoji in a name, a composed character —
// and a caret counted in code units eventually lands between the halves of a surrogate pair, where a
// backspace deletes half a character and leaves a replacement glyph behind. Every function below goes
// through `charsOf`, which is the only place that decides what "one character" means.
