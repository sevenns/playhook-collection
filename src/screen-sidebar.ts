// Ported 1:1 from playhook @ c26fae7 (release/v0.8.0) : src/renderer/screen-sidebar.ts
// Do not diverge without reason — see PORTED-FROM.md. In the launcher it serves Settings, Customize and
// the Library; here the Library screen is its only user so far.
//
// The left-hand column both settings screens are built around: the sections of the screen, then the
// actions that end it (Save, Discard, Close…).
//
// It exists because a one-column form makes its own actions unreachable. Every screen here is
// bottom-anchored — Save and Close live at the END of the list — so committing anything meant running
// the whole form to the bottom first, every time, on a gamepad. With the sections split off into a
// column of their own, the actions are a fixed handful of steps away from wherever you are, and the pane
// beside them only ever holds the rows of one section.
//
// Movement here is CYCLIC, unlike the pane's: the column is short and closed, so wrapping from the last
// entry to the first is the shortest path to the actions rather than a surprise. The pane stays clamped
// — a long list that wraps loses your place.
