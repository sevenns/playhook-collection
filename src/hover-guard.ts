// The "did the MOUSE move, or did the UI move under it?" guard, shared by every surface that opens on
// top of another one (Settings, Customize, the file picker, the on-screen keyboard).
//
// A surface that opens under a resting cursor makes Chromium fire pointer events at it: the element
// moved, not the mouse. Taken as hover, that drags the focus off whatever the surface just focused (the
// current value, the bottom button) — the "it opened and blinked" stutter, reproducible by simply parking
// the mouse where an item will appear. Comparing against the previous event's coordinates is not enough
// on its own: the guard has to already KNOW where the pointer is, which is why `track` runs from a
// window-level listener that keeps going while everything is closed.
//
// So opening ARMS the guard at the pointer's current position, and hover stays asleep until the mouse has
// actually travelled HOVER_WAKE_PX from there.

/** How far the pointer must travel before hover may take the focus again. */
