// The six navigation primitives, as a contract. Every surface of the launcher that can hold the focus
// implements it — the Settings screen, the Customize screen, and the surfaces that open ON TOP of
// Customize (the on-screen keyboard, the file picker). controls.ts routes into one of them; a screen with
// its own stack routes further into whichever of its surfaces is on top.
//
// It is a type, not a base class, precisely so a screen can satisfy it while owning its state however it
// likes: the point is that `left` means the same thing everywhere the user presses it.
