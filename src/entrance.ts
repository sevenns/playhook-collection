// Ported 1:1 from playhook @ c26fae7 (release/v0.8.0) : src/renderer/entrance.ts
// Do not diverge without reason — see PORTED-FROM.md.
// The one-shot entrance every list on this launcher plays: its rows arrive from below, in the order they
// are read (@keyframes popup-item-in, staggered by --row-index / --osk-row).
//
// It marks the ROWS, not their container, and that is the whole point. The obvious shape — a class on the
// box for as long as the animation lasts, with a descendant selector under it — turns the class into a
// WINDOW: anything built while it is up matches too, and starts the entrance from zero. Every one of
// these lists rebuilds its contents far more often than it opens (the keyboard rebuilds all of its keys
// on every Shift, and again on every character typed with Shift on; the settings panes rebuild on a
// deferred preview and on the validator coming back), and a rebuild landing inside that window replayed
// the whole entrance — the surface visibly re-arriving a beat after it had already arrived. Marking the
// rows that exist AT THE MOMENT OF ARMING is immune to it: rows made later were not part of the arrival
// and simply appear.
//
// The mark is dropped on a timer rather than on `animationend`: with the stagger, the last row's event is
// the only one that means "all done", and a row removed mid-flight never fires one at all.
