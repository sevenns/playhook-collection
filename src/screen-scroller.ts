// The scrolling behaviour of every full-screen surface: one fixed duration and easing, plus the edge
// fades that soften a row cut by the clip. Only the Library screen uses it here; the launcher shares it
// with Settings, Customize and the file picker.
//
// BROWSER: its `pxUnit` stays behind — the launcher parses the vh number out of `--px`, which this
// site's `min()` expression does not allow (see px-unit.ts).
